## **Your Drupal Codebases Are Black Holes**

***You*** **don’t know Drupal inside and out.** Client emails turn into fires; bugs turn into epics. You suspect that your sprints aren’t running smoothly but don’t know why. You’ve fired a developer and worried about what they left behind. **You tell clients that you have** **Senior Drupal Developers™,** **but do you really know that?** 

## **Imagine Being Rid Of The Uncertainty**

**Imagine this** – Imagine a month where sparks don’t turn into fires. Imagine shedding the baggage that your not-so-senior developer stuck you with. Imagine fixing best practice issues that you didn’t even know were there. **Imagine delivering 100% confidence to your clients with 100% confidence.**

## **Get A Personalized Evaluation From A Full Stack Drupal Specialist**

**Get Peace of Mind** – All it takes to identify cancer in a codebase is somebody who knows exactly what to look for. Let me be your eyes. Book a codebase audit with me now. Why?

- I’ve been specializing in Drupal development for nearly a decade
- I’m intimately familiar with the pitfalls encountered by smaller teams
- I’m obsessed with building codebases that could be updated tomorrow if I died today

### **Here’s How It Works:**

You give me read-only access to a Drupal codebase and I get started on the evaluation. That’s it. No databases. No private user info. No stress.

After I have access to the codebase, I’ll begin combing through your custom modules and themes in search of:

- standards and best practice violations
- code-style issues that make code difficult to read, maintain, and keep bug-free.

Within a couple of weeks you will receive a personalized, codebase-specific report that aggregates my findings along with steps you can take to fix them.

## **Ready To Get Started?**

Are you ready to bring your Drupal codebase up to snuff? Great! Contact me at mrweiner@gmail.com to apply for your personalized audit. 

## **100% Money-Back Guarantee!**

I’m so sure that I can provide *at least* one piece of high-value insight into your codebase that I offer a 100% money-back guarantee. **If after you receive your report you feel you have not gotten your money’s worth, just let me know and I’ll refund your payment in full.**

## **Wait! Don’t Take My Word For it...**

Here’s what some folks I’ve worked with have said.

> Matt was extremely professional and helped us get our Drupal project off the ground. He is very knowledgeable and helped solve problems before they happened. When our project changed from v7 to v8 he was able to help us hit the ground running even though it was a fast and unexpected change.

- *Jim Handwerk, Savvee Consulting*

> Excellent. Great communication and gets things done quickly & accurately. Would recommend him to anyone and will continue to use Matt myself.

- *Ryan Ciocca, Clickovation*

> Matt does a great job! Very thorough, patient and accurate.

- *Woody Klemmer, Gladlydo.com*

> Matt knows his field very well. Highly recommend A+
- *Jesse, Mission Studio*

## **Still Have Questions?**

### **What constitutes “standards & best practices”?**

The short answer is the stuff on [this page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards). 

The long answer is that there are additional conventions encouraged by the community to produce reliable, maintainable code that are not documented on that page because of the process involved in updating the handbook. I’m familiar with these conventions because of my immersion in the ecosystem.

### **What constitutes “coding-style issues”?**

Things like underutilizing Drupal’s hook system, unnecessarily-deeply-nested business logic, poorly organized module and theme directories, and improper use of css selectors fall under this designation. 

### **Will you fix all of the issues?**

I’ll do my best to identify a majority of the issues in your code, and the report you receive will provide insight into how they can be addressed. I will not be fixing those issues for you during the course of this audit.

### **Our client probably won't provide the budget to fix the problems anyway. What’s the point?**

Best practice code results in less bugs, which means lower costs to the client, faster turnaround from your developers, and a less stressful engagement overall. If you're maintaining an ongoing relationship with the client then it's in your own best interest to at least *understand* the problems that exist in their (your) code.

Aside from the immediate benefits to this specific codebase, my findings can immediately be used as a guide for your developers regarding what they can fix, and should avoid, on any of your projects in the future.

### **Do you audit all of the modules and themes installed on the site?**

I will be auditing all of your *custom* modules and themes, since that is the code that is primarily written & maintained by your team. Drupal Core and contrib modules & themes are out of the scope of this report.

### **Will you sign an NDA before the audit?**

No. For an engagement as small as this, it makes little financial sense to get lawyers involved.
